Sometimes a download can become corrupted for various reasons.  However, you can verify that the release package you downloaded is correct by checking the md5 checksum "fingerprint" of your download against the md5 checksum value shown on the Releases page.  Even the smallest change in the downloaded release package will cause a different value to be shown!
* If you are using Windows, you can download a checksum verifier tool and instructions directly from Microsoft here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11533
* If you are using Linux or OS X, you already have the software installed on your system.
* On Linux systems use the md5sum program.  For example:
* md5sum filename
* On OS X use the md5 program.  For example:
* md5 filename
